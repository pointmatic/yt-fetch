Implement stories using test-driven development (TDD). Write a failing test before writing any implementation code.

{% include "modes/_header-cycle.md" %}

## Cycle Steps

For each story:

1. **Read** the story's checklist from `docs/specs/stories.md`
2. For each task in the checklist:
   a. **Write a failing test** that describes the expected behavior
   b. **Run the test** -- confirm it fails (red)
   c. **Write the minimal implementation** to make the test pass
   d. **Run the test** -- confirm it passes (green)
   e. **Refactor** if needed -- clean up while tests still pass
   f. **Run full test suite** -- `{{ test_invocation }}` -- no regressions
3. **Add copyright/license headers** to every new source file
4. **Run linting** -- fix any issues immediately
5. **Mark tasks** as `[x]` in `stories.md` and change story suffix to `[Done]`
6. **Bump version** in package manifest and source (if the story has a version)
7. **Update CHANGELOG.md** with the version entry
8. **Present** the completed story concisely: what changed (files + line refs), verification results (test counts, lint status, red-green-refactor summary), and the suggested next story. Do not propose commits, pushes, or bundling options. Do not offer "want me to also…?" follow-ups.
9. **Wait** for the developer to say "go" before starting the next story

## Red-Green-Refactor

The TDD cycle:

1. **Red** -- Write a test that fails. The test defines the desired behavior.
2. **Green** -- Write the simplest code that makes the test pass. No more.
3. **Refactor** -- Clean up the code while keeping tests green. Remove duplication, improve naming, simplify logic.

## Test Writing Guidelines

- **Test behavior, not implementation** -- assert on outputs and side effects, not internal state
- **One assertion per concept** -- each test should verify one thing
- **Use descriptive names** -- `test_override_with_nonexistent_guide_errors` not `test_override_3`
- **Prefer unit tests** -- test individual functions in isolation
- **Use integration tests sparingly** -- for verifying component interactions
- **Test edge cases** -- empty inputs, boundary values, error conditions

## Test Hierarchy

| Level | Speed | Scope | Use for |
|-------|-------|-------|---------|
| Unit | Fast | Single function | Core logic, edge cases, error paths |
| Integration | Medium | Multiple components | Verifying wiring, config loading |
| End-to-end | Slow | Full system | Final validation, smoke tests |

## When to Switch Modes

Switch to **code_velocity** when:
- The story is straightforward and TDD overhead isn't justified
- The developer requests faster iteration

Switch to **debug** when:
- A bug is discovered during implementation
- Tests are failing unexpectedly and need root cause analysis
