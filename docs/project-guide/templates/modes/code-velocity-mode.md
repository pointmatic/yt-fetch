Implement stories rapidly with direct commits to main. Focus on feature completion and iteration speed over process overhead.

## Cycle Steps

For each story:

1. **Read** the story's checklist from `docs/specs/stories.md`
2. **Implement** all tasks in the checklist
3. **Add copyright/license headers** to every new source file
4. **Run tests** -- `{{ test_invocation }}` (fix failures before continuing)
5. **Run linting** -- fix any issues immediately
6. **Mark tasks** as `[x]` in `stories.md` and change story suffix to `[Done]`
7. **Bump version** in package manifest and source (if the story has a version)
8. **Update CHANGELOG.md** with the version entry
9. **Present** the completed story concisely: what changed (files + line refs), verification results (test counts, lint status), and the suggested next story. Do not propose commits, pushes, or bundling options. Do not offer "want me to also…?" follow-ups.
10. **Wait** for the developer to say "go" before starting the next story

## Velocity Practices

**LLM's role in each cycle:**

- **Version bump per story** -- v0.1.0, v0.2.0, v0.3.0, etc. — bump in package manifest and source
- **Minimal process overhead** -- focus on making it work, not making it perfect
- **Tests run after every story** -- not after every file, but before presenting to developer
- **Fix linting immediately** -- small incremental fixes, not batch cleanup
- **Update CHANGELOG.md** with the version entry before presenting

**Developer's role (do NOT prompt for, offer, or initiate):**

- **Direct commits to main** -- no branches, no PRs, no code review (velocity convention)
- **Commit messages** reference story IDs: `"Story A.a: v0.1.0 Hello World"`
- **Decides when to commit** -- the LLM presents, the developer commits. Multiple stories may be bundled into one commit at the developer's discretion — that is not the LLM's call to make or suggest.

## Story Ordering

- Start with Story A.a (Hello World) if not yet implemented
- If unclear which story is next, ask: "Which story should I work on next?"
- Never skip ahead -- complete stories in order within each phase

## File Header Reminder

Every new source file must include the copyright and license header as the very first content (before code, docstrings, or imports).

## When to Switch Modes

Switch to **code_test_first** when:
- Working on a story with complex logic that benefits from TDD
- The developer requests test-first approach

Switch to **debug** when:
- A bug is discovered during implementation
- Tests are failing unexpectedly

Switch to **production mode** when:
- CI/CD phase is complete and branch protection is enabled
- The project is ready for public users
