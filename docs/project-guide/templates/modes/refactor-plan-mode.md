Rewrite or update existing planning documents because of new features, improvements, or to migrate legacy formats into the v2.x artifact template structure.

{% include "modes/_header-cycle.md" %}

## Targets

The following documents may need updating (in order):

1. `{{ spec_artifacts_path }}/concept.md` — artifact template: `templates/artifacts/concept.md`
2. `{{ spec_artifacts_path }}/features.md` — artifact template: `templates/artifacts/features.md`
3. `{{ spec_artifacts_path }}/tech-spec.md` — artifact template: `templates/artifacts/tech-spec.md`

Skip any document that does not exist. If a document already reflects the current state of the project, confirm with the developer and skip.

## Cycle Steps (for each document)

### Step 1: Understand the Change

Ask the developer what needs updating and why. This could be:
- **New features or improvements** — sections need to reflect new capabilities, architecture changes, or revised scope
- **Legacy migration** — the document predates the v2.x artifact template format and needs restructuring

### Step 2: Backup

Copy the existing document to `<doc_name>_old.md` before making changes:

```
docs/specs/concept.md → docs/specs/concept_old.md
```

This protects against uncommitted work being overwritten.

### Step 3: Read and Extract

Read the old document as the primary source of information. Read the corresponding artifact template at `templates/artifacts/<doc_name>.md` to understand the target structure and required sections.

Map the old document's content to the artifact template sections. Note what needs to change based on the developer's instructions from Step 1.

### Step 4: Fill Gaps

If any sections required by the artifact template are missing or need new content:

1. Note which sections are missing or outdated
2. Ask the developer for the missing information
3. Wait for the developer's response before proceeding

Do not invent content — only use information from the old document or the developer.

### Step 5: Generate Updated Document

Write the updated document using the artifact template structure, incorporating:
- Existing content that is still accurate
- Updates based on the developer's instructions
- Any new information provided by the developer

### Step 6: Legacy Content

If any information from the old document does not fit into the artifact template sections, append it to the end of the new document:

```markdown
---

## Legacy Content

<content that didn't map to any template section>
```

If all content mapped cleanly, omit this section.

### Step 7: Present for Approval

Present the completed document to the developer. Show:
- What changed and why
- Which sections were preserved, updated, or added
- Whether a Legacy Content section was added

Iterate as needed until the developer approves. Then proceed to the next document in the targets list.

### Step 8: Cleanup

After the developer approves, the `_old.md` backup can be deleted at the developer's discretion. Do not delete it automatically.

## Final Step: Revisit Project Essentials

After all document cycles are complete, run this step **once** (not per-document) to refresh `docs/specs/project-essentials.md` with any must-know facts the refactor introduced. This is distinct from the per-document cycle above — `project-essentials.md` is freeform and short, and asking about it once at the end gives the developer a chance to capture cross-document changes.

### Step F.1: Check for Existing File

Check whether `docs/specs/project-essentials.md` exists:

- **If it exists**: this is the **modify** path. Read the current content and keep it in mind while asking the prompt below.
- **If it does NOT exist**: this is the **create** path. This is especially common for legacy projects being migrated to the v2.x artifact structure — they are the highest-value case for project-essentials capture, because none of their conventions have been written down. Be especially explicit in the prompt below: the developer may never have articulated these rules even to themselves.

### Step F.2: Ask the Refactor-Revisit Prompt

Ask the developer whether the refactor introduced any new must-know facts that future LLMs should know to avoid blunders. Put these **concrete worked examples** in front of the developer — not abstract category names — because a refactor often touches things the developer has already internalized and forgotten they're non-obvious:

- **Switched or added an environment manager.** Did the refactor adopt or replace a tool like `pyve`, `uv`, `poetry`, or `hatch`? If so, capture the canonical Python invocation and dev-tool install commands. *Example:* "We switched from `poetry` to `pyve`. Canonical runtime invocation is now `pyve run python ...`; dev tools are in a separate testenv via `pyve testenv run ruff ...`. Do NOT use `poetry run` — the `pyproject.toml` still has leftover poetry config but poetry is no longer installed."
- **Split runtime from dev environment.** Did the refactor move dev tools (pytest, ruff, mypy) out of the main venv into a dedicated testenv? If so, capture which commands target which env, and explicitly note the **anti-pattern** to avoid. *Example:* "Dev tools live in `.pyve/testenv/venv/`, not `.venv/`. Use `pyve test` for pytest, `pyve testenv run mypy` for type-check. **Never** run `pip install -e '.[dev]'` — that pollutes the runtime venv and breaks the isolation contract."
- **Renamed module or moved source-of-truth.** Did the refactor move a file that looks hand-edited but is actually generated or installed from elsewhere? Capture the source-of-truth path and the installed-copy path so the LLM doesn't edit the copy. *Example:* "Template source moved from `docs/guides/` to `project_guide/templates/project-guide/`. The `docs/project-guide/` directory is now an installed copy — NEVER hand-edit files there."
- **Changed domain conventions.** Did the refactor change how domain values are represented? *Example:* "Money representation changed from float dollars to integer cents. All new code must use `int` for money; the old `Decimal`-based `money_old.py` module is deprecated but not yet removed."
- **New auto-generated or hidden-coupling files.** Did the refactor introduce a build step that regenerates a file, or a pair of files that must stay in sync? *Example:* "`docs/project-guide/go.md` is re-rendered by `project-guide mode <name>`. Never hand-edit it — run `project-guide mode default` to regenerate."
- **Principle:** If the refactor introduced a fork-in-the-road where the *wrong* choice still "works" (runs, compiles, passes some tests), that is a project-essential. The goal is to prevent future LLMs from random-walking to a legitimate-looking-but-wrong answer.

**Skip if there are none.** If the refactor genuinely did not introduce any new must-know facts (pure doc-restructure with no tool/architecture/convention change), confirm with the developer and skip this step entirely.

### Step F.3: Generate or Update the File

Depending on Step F.1's branch:

- **Create path**: Generate a new `docs/specs/project-essentials.md` from the artifact template at `templates/artifacts/project-essentials.md`. For legacy projects, this is often the first time these rules have been written down — take the time to capture them properly. Present to the developer for approval and iterate as needed.
- **Modify path**: Read the existing `docs/specs/project-essentials.md`, integrate the new facts from Step F.2, and write the updated file. Preserve existing content that is still accurate; update content that the refactor has changed; add new sections for new categories.

In both paths, follow the artifact template's heading convention: **do NOT include a top-level `#` heading** (the rendered `go.md` wrapper provides `## Project Essentials`), and use `###` for subsection headings so they nest correctly.

### Step F.4: Approval

Present the completed (or updated) `project-essentials.md` to the developer for approval. Show:
- What was added (new facts from the refactor)
- What was modified (existing facts the refactor invalidated)
- What was preserved (existing facts the refactor did not touch)

Iterate as needed. Once approved, this cycle ends.
